# queuetools

A collection of tools that make a distributed, heterogeneous workstation queue easier to leverage. Primarily, these tools are supposed to work within the [Beckstein Lab](http://becksteinlab.physics.asu.edu) at ASU but some might be useful elsewhere, too. In particular, we use the `qsub_dependents` script on major XSEDE supercomputers.

THE SCRIPTS ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" WITH NO GUARANTEE THAT THEY WILL WORK FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Please read the code and understand what they are doing before using them.

If you find bugs please feel free to raise issues in the [Issue Tracker](/Becksteinlab/queuetools/issues).
